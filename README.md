# D365FO-DeveloperOpenSourceToolkit (D365FO-DOST)
The **Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations Developer Toolkit (aka D365FO-DOST)** is a repository of tools, patterns, and best practices examples for developers and sys admins.  If you run across something that has been a pain point or manual process that you were able to automate or improve, and would like to share with others, then this is the place for you.  Anyone involved with D365FO is welcome to contribute including D365FO ISVs, partners, customers, consultants, and Microsoft employees. 

This is my first GIT project and first open source project, so I'm sure I have some things up incorrectly and I welcome any suggestions. 

The project structure is broken into 3 main folders: 
1. ApplicationCode - this is X++ code, organized into Packages and Models that can be imported into your D365FO environment, and provide examples and code samples of how to achieve various tasks.
1. SQL - SQL scripts to help show how various tables are related
1. SysAdmin - PowerShell and other script to assist in system adminstration. i.e. copying databases between environments, installing deployable packages, installing hotfixes, etc.
